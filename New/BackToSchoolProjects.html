In the 2012–2013 school year, over 4,200 Westerville school students qualified for subsidized meals. This is a 340% student increase over the number of students who qualified in the 1998–1999 school year.  When schools are in recess, these students do not have access to two meals.  The Holiday Project Food Drive provides extra food for the students and their families, to ensure that no one goes hungry.<br /><br />The food drive is a community-wide project. Over 50 Westerville community businesses allow donation boxes to be placed on their premises. In addition, organizations, civic groups, city employees, and the school district have their own food drives, and donate what they collect to Westerville Caring & Sharing. During the 1997 Holiday Project, Westerville City middle school students collected approximately 8,000 canned goods; and in 1998, city employees donated approximately 8,200 pounds of food.  In 2008, 15,569 food items were donated. In 2010, the community donated 13,381 food items. With available funds, WC&S volunteers bought another 572 items which brought the total for 2010 to 13,953 items. For the 2012 Holiday Project Food Drive, 9,961 food items were donated. Additional food items for that year were not bought by WC&S volunteers due to insufficient funds.</span></div>

The Back-to-School project is designed to help families with school-aged children who might be overwhelmed in providing school supplies and clothing.  We give students the same type of school supplies and book bags that everyone else has. In addition to school supplies, personal hygiene products are also given as these items cannot be purchased with an EBT card.  It is important that these students start the school year on an equal footing with their peers.<br /><br /></span></div>
