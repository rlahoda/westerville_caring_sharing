WC&S serves Westerville students who qualify for the subsidized lunch program. As more families have moved into the Westerville City School District, the diversity of the district increased and the number of families in need has increased. <br /><br />
The Holiday Project has two components—Christmas Gift Sponsorship and Food Drive. The Holiday Project helps students and their families with items from their wish list, food basket, gift certificates, and personal hygiene products. We cannot do what we do without the cooperation and participation of the Westerville community. <br /><br/>The community’s involvement revolves around four key areas: <br /> 
<ul><li>Sponsoring a child or a teenager</li><li>Giving a financial donation</li><li>Volunteering their time</li><li>Organizing a food drive</li></ul></span></div>

<div class="col-10" style="float:left;"><h3 style="color:#F08080;">Christmas Sponsorship Program</h3><span  id="paragraphStyle3">The Westerville Caring & Sharing Holiday Project assists students and their families with gifts, food baskets, personal hygiene and household products through a sponsorship, consisting of individuals and/or businesses/organizations. The Christmas sponsorship is a community-wide project where WC&S recruits sponsors to provide items from a student’s wish list. Every year, families fill out an application to participate in the Holiday Project. Once accepted, students and/or parents /guardians fill out a wish-list where requests for clothing, toys, electronics, books, etc are recorded. A sponsor is then matched with a student(s) to purchase items from the wish list. The sponsors then deliver the gifts to the distribution site. <br /><br />The Westerville community supports us in many ways. Civic groups donate winter coats for children ranging in age from pre-school to high school. Many restaurants donate a portion of the day’s proceeds to Westerville Caring & Sharing. Fundraisers from different organizations and school students were held to raise money to buy gift certificates and other items for students and their families. As an example of student involvement with WC&S,  Westerville elementary students raised $225.81 by collecting pennies. In 2010, the three high schools donated $39,465 .  <br /><br /></span></div>
