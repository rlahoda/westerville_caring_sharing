    <h2>Holiday Project</h2>
    <p>The Westerville Caring & Sharing (WC&S) Holiday Project was started in 1988 as a way to reach out to Westerville families who were experiencing economic hardships due to low-paying jobs, illness, job loss, or disaster. WC&S serves Westerville students who qualify for the subsidized lunch program. As more families have moved into the Westerville City School District, the diversity of the district increased and the number of families in need has increased.
    <br><br>
    The Holiday Project has two components—Christmas Gift Sponsorship and Food Drive. The Holiday Project helps students and their families with items from their wish list, food basket, gift certificates, and personal hygiene products. Westerville Caring & Sharing cannot do what they do without the cooperation and participation of the Westerville community. The community’s involvement revolves around four key areas:</p>

    <ul><li>Sponsoring a child or a teenager</li>
    <li>Giving a financial donation</li>
    <li>Volunteering their time</li>
    <li>Organizing a food drive</li></ul>

    <h2>Back To School Project</h2>
    <p>With having a successful Holiday Project in 1988, the members of Westerville Caring & Sharing (WC&S) expanded a year later to help students with back to school supplies. The Back-to-School project is designed to help families with school-aged children who might be overwhelmed in providing school supplies and clothing.
    <br><br>
    Families who qualify for the subsidized lunch program are eligible to participate in the Back to School project. These families might have experienced economic hardships, illness, or disaster. WC& S gives students the same type of school supplies that everyone else has. This allows the students on subsidized lunch program to start the school year on an equal footing.
    <br><br>
    The WC&S Back-to-School Project assists students and their families with a book bag and age-appropriate school supplies. In addition to school supplies, personal hygiene products are also given as these items cannot be purchased with food stamps. In the 2012-2013 school year, over 4200 Westerville school students qualified for subsidized meals. This is a 340% student increase over the number of students who qualified in the 1998-1999 school year. It is important that these students start the school year on an equal footing with their peers.</p>
