      <h2>Christmas Sponsorship Program</h2>
      <p>The Westerville Caring & Sharing Holiday Project assists students and their families with gifts, food baskets, personal hygiene and household products through a sponsorship, consisting of individuals and/or businesses/organizations. In the 2012–2013 school year, over 4,200 Westerville school students qualified for the Christmas sponsorships. This is a 340% increase over the number of students who qualified in the 1998–1999 school year. Without sponsors, many families would not be able to exchange gifts on Christmas.
      <br><br>
      The Christmas sponsorship is a community-wide project where WC&S recruits sponsors to provide items from a student’s wish list. Sponsors are asked to spend a minimum dollar amount per student. Every year, families fill out an application to participate in the Holiday Project. Once accepted, students and/or parents /guardians fill out a wish-list where requests for clothing, toys, electronics, books, etc are recorded. A sponsor is then matched with a student(s) to purchase items from the wish list. The sponsors then deliver the gifts to the distribution site.
      <br><br>
      The Westerville community supports WC&S in many ways. Civic groups donate winter coats for children ranging in age from pre-school to high school. Many restaurants donate a portion of the day’s proceeds to Westerville Caring & Sharing. Fundraisers from different organizations and school students were held to raise money to buy gift certificates and other items for students and their families. As an example of student involvement with WC&S, in 1999 , Westerville elementary students raised $225.81 by collecting pennies. In 2001, Westerville’s two high schools raised $34,300 and in 2010, the three high schools donated $39,465 . On occasions, WC&S does not have enough funds or sponsors to assist the families which have applied to the Holiday Project. Articles in the Westerville News & Public Opinion appealed to the community for support.</p>

      <h2>Food Drive Program</h2>
      <p>The Westerville Caring & Sharing Holiday Project assists students and their families with gifts, food baskets, personal hygiene and household products. In the 2012–2013 school year, over 4,200 Westerville school students qualified for subsidized meals. This is a 340% student increase over the number of students who qualified in the 1998–1999 school year. When schools are in recess, these students do not have access to two meals. The Holiday Project Food Drive provides extra food for the students and their families, to ensure that no one goes hungry.
      <br><br>
      The food drive is a community-wide project. Over 50 Westerville community businesses allow donation boxes to be placed on their premises. In addition, organizations, civic groups, city employees, and the school district have their own food drives, and donate what they collect to Westerville Caring & Sharing. During the 1997 Holiday Project, Westerville City middle school students collected approximately 8,000 canned goods; and in 1998, city employees donated approximately 8,200 pounds of food. In 2008, 15,569 food items were donated. In 2010, the community donated 13,381 food items. With available funds, WC&S volunteers bought another 572 items which brought the total for 2010 to 13,953 items. For the 2012 Holiday Project Food Drive, 9,961 food items were donated. Additional food items for that year were not bought by WC&S volunteers due to insufficient funds.</p>
