    <h2>Holiday Project</h2>
    <p>The Holiday Project, which was started in 1988, has two componentsâ€”Holiday Gift Sponsorship and Food Drive. The Holiday Project helps students and their families with items from their wish list, food basket, gift certificates, and personal hygiene products. We cannot do what we do without the cooperation and participation of the Westerville community.</p>

    <h2>Back To School Project</h2>
    <p>The Back-to-School project is designed to help families with school-aged children who might be overwhelmed in providing school supplies and clothing. We give students the same type of school supplies that every other student has. This allows the students on subsidized lunch program to start the school year on an equal footing.</p>
